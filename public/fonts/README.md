# Aisle Font Files

This directory should contain the Aisle custom font files for the B.A.M.E Health & Care Awards website.

## Required Files

Please add the following font files to this directory:

- `Aisle.woff2` - Modern web font format (preferred)
- `Aisle.woff` - Fallback web font format

## Font Usage

The Aisle font is used as an accent font throughout the website and can be applied using the Tailwind CSS class:

```html
<div class="font-accent">Your text here</div>
```

## Font Sources

If you don't have the Aisle font files, please:
1. Contact your design team or brand manager
2. Check your brand assets repository
3. Ensure you have the proper licensing for web use

## Fallback

If the Aisle font files are not available, the website will gracefully fall back to:
- Georgia (serif)
- System default serif fonts

The website will continue to function normally without these files, but the brand typography will not be complete.
